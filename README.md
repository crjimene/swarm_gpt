# Code Repository for the paper: Multi-Agent Systems Powered by Large Language Models: Applications in Swarm Intelligence

Source code of the ant colony and flocking simulations with OpenAI GPT4o and NetLogo

## Description

This work explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent simulations by replacing traditional hard-coded agent programs with LLM-driven prompts. It focuses on two examples from swarm intelligence: ant colony foraging and bird flocking. A key component of this study is a toolchain that connects LLMs with the NetLogo simulation platform, using its Python extension to communicate with GPT-4 via the OpenAI API. This setup allows for prompt-driven behavior generation, enabling agents to adapt to environmental data. The research employs both structured, rule-based prompts and autonomous, knowledge-driven prompts. Ultimately, it demonstrates how this toolchain can help LLMs investigate self-organizing processes and generate emergent behaviors in multi-agent environments, offering new methods for studying intelligent systems and modeling swarm intelligence inspired by nature.
